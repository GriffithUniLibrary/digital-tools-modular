## Images

{% capture images %}

Journals usually have specific requirements for the size, resolution, format and colour of the figures or images in your paper. Once youve determined what the requirements are, you may need to use a graphics tool to change the format of your image files.

- **[PhotoShop](https://www.adobe.com)**: `PhotoShop` has become the de facto standard for image editing programs over its more than thirty-year lifespan. It's highly capable, but probably overkill if all you need is to resize a few files. It is also costly. Griffith has PhotoShop installed on its student-use computers on campus. 
- **[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org)**: The GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) is a free and open source image editor, also very high-powered, like PhotoShop. It runs on all platforms and is highly regarded. Again, if all you are doing is resizing a few images, perhaps it is overkill. 
- **[Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com)**: A popular, and much more affordable, alternative to PhotoShop on the Mac.
- **[Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/)**: Another high-quality and popular alternative to the Adobe software.
- **[XNView](https://www.xnview.com/en/)**: A free, multiplatform image processor specifically aimed at resizing and format conversion.
