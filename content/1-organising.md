{% capture connectednotes %}
A new stable of lightweight apps designed to help researchers connect their thoughts together have begun to emerge. The idea behind their popularity is that knowledge tends to work associatively rather than hierachically. Most or all of them use Markdown syntax for writing.

Our recommendation: **Notion**

Notion is free for educational users. It is the easiest to get started with and the most visually attractive (if you like that sort of thing). There is a large and active community sharing Notion dashboards and designs, and many YouTube accounts describing how they use Notion to manage their study and life.

Runner up: **Obsidian**

Obsidian is free and open source, and has many plug-ins that extend its capability. Its documents are plain Markdown (.md) text files, meaning it's extremely easy to migrate to and from the app to any other.
