### ðŸ““ Composition

**Recommended**
 - [LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com) - `LaTeX` is a text formatting language (like `Markdown`) which is very flexible and robust. It is format agnostic your document structure, headings and figures can use any style you like. Overleaf is a web-based LaTeX editor with many built-in templates and automatic preview. It can automatically format your paper for certain journals and even submit them for you.
 - [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/) - designed for long-form writing
 - [Hemingway Editor](http://hemingwayapp.com/) - This website checks your text for readability. It warns you if you are being too verbose or your sentences are too long. Use it as a good guideline, without relying on it too heavily. 

**Other tools**
 - [Microsoft Word](https://www.office.com) - popularâ€”ubiquitous, almostâ€”but not always the best tool
 - [Manuscripts](https://www.manuscriptsapp.com)
 - [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com) - 'Google Docs for scientists', automatic journal submission
