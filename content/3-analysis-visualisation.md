## Data visualisation

{% capture text %}
No matter what tool you use, you'll need a little bit of training to make good data visualisations. RED offers workshops on [data visualisation and data storytelling](https://app.secure.griffith.edu.au/events/category/developing-researcher-training-program). The Library has also produced an [online introduction](https://sway.office.com/O9vEKmTmBXPxGOnE) you might find useful.

**Our recommendation: Tableau**

Tableau can produce beautiful results quickly and is free to academic researchers. It's not supported by the University, but neither are any of the others.
