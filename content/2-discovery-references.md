## Manage your references

{% capture text %}
- [EndNote](https://www.griffith.edu.au/library/study/referencing) is Griffith's supported option. [Workshops](https://www.griffith.edu.au/research/research-services/researcher-education-development/workshop-calendar) and [video resources](vimeo.com/user/82369617/folder/1569944) are available too.
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) is free and open-source. This makes it a popular option among FOSS enthusiasts.
- [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com) is popular in part because of its inbuilt social network.

**Our recommendation: EndNote**

Not everybody loves using EndNote, but you can get a free copy along with technical support through the University. That makes it worth the price of admission.

{% capture rurefman %}
**Runner up: Zotero**

Zotero is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), has a committed community of users and developers and has plugins that allow it to integrate with other useful apps. The only downside is that there is no support form the University.
