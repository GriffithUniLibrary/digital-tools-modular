You can make the process of finding relevant papers less arduous by using tools to recommend similar or related papers to you/ Some of them also help to visualise connections between the papers in your field or research project. 

- **[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_alerts?view_op=list_alerts&hl=en)**: Create alerts in Google Scholar so you can be emailed when papers mathching specific keywords are published. A broad approach that might result in some irrelevant papers, but highly automated and convenient. 

- **[Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com)**: A visual tool to help researchers and applied scientists find and explore papers relevant to their field of work. Papers are arranged according to their similarity. Even papers that do not directly cite each other can be strongly connected and very closely positioned. Connected Papers is not a citation tree.

- **[Open Knowledge Maps](https://openknowledgemaps.org)**: This free visualisation tool groups related topics together and presents papers on those topics in a packed-bubble type graph. Can filter for open access resources. 

- **[ResearchRabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai)**: Billing itself as 'Spotify for researchers', ResearchRabbit is the newest of the tools here. It generates recommendations based on your library and your preferences. It can also email you with new relevant research, like Google Scholar.

- **[CitNet Explorer](https://www.citnetexplorer.nl/)**: CitNetExplorer is a software tool for visualizing and analyzing citation networks of scientific publications. It has not been updated in some time.
